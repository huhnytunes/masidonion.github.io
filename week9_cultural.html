	<h1>My Thinking Style (and what I think about it)</h1> 
		<p> My two thinking styles are <b>Concrete Random</b> and <b>Abstract Random</b>. At the heart of each of these is the 'random' ordering ability, which according to Anythony Gregorc (the father of the Mind Styles Model of Thinking) dictates that my mind organizes information by chunks and in no particular order. This leads to the ability to skip certain steps in a given procedure and still get the desired result, thanks to the randomness of my own ordering. I like to think of it as organized chaos. Even more spcifically, my concrete random thinking attribute means that I like to experiment to find answers and take risks when doing so. On the other hand, an abstract random thinker like myself enjoys listening to others and bringing harmony to group situtions. </p>
		<p> I feel that all of these attributes will aid my in my strife at DBC ... and already have to some extent! Because of the overall randomness of my thinking style, it has allowed me throughout the prep work to 'hop around' a bit in terms of the learning: one day I might focus on a single topic, let's say JavaScript, and the next day, something entirely different, like Ruby or SQL. Although this affords me flexibility in my learning and as stated by Gregorc, still allows me to arrive at the given destination (in this case, adequate learning and retention), I must admit that it can sometimes be a curse just as much as a blessing. I have found that sometimes my thinking style and methodology can sometimes leave me a little 'scatter-brained' when it comes to approach, and this fact often dictates that I do not learn any one of the concepts as well as I should, rather learning <em>all of them</em> just pretty well. </p> 
		<p> Ultimately, it is up to me to make sure that I concentrate fully on the given material that I am currently working on, allowing my randomness to bolster my learning rather than harm it. I especially am proud of my ability to bring harmony to group situations (as governed by my strong abstract randomness attribute), and it is qualities like these, as highlighted by the Gregorc Thinking Styles, that I look forward to honing and polishing at DBC in terms of my overall application to the program. <p> 
    	<p> Looking forward to making this hope a reality in just a few short days now !! </p>
