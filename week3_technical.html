	<h1> Looping in Ruby! </h1> 
		<p> There are various ways to loop in Ruby, each with their own benefits and drawbacks, and by understanding each of these, one can decide the best one to use in any given situation. Today, I will help you do just that! By explaining the various Ruby loops and when to use each: </p>
		<p> The first type of Ruby loop is the most basic: the 'while' loop. This does exactly what it sounds like ... the code executes a certain command 'until' a certain condition is met. For example, print 'Hey' until user responds 'hey' back. Obviously this is a very rudimental example, but it demonstrates the basic syntax of the while loop. One of the keys here is the inclusion of a boolean statement, or a true or false variable, that is the engine of this loop as it will execute 'while' the statement is true. In this sense, 'while' loops are advisable when the boolean is positive, known and needs to be controllable. </p>
		<p> The second type of Ruby loop, similar to the first (actually, its opposite!), is the 'until' loop. The until loop, again, does just what it says it does: executes code 'until' a certain condition is not true. In other words, the boolean statement governs the flow of the loop until it is false. So use this type of loop when you are in a circumstance similar to the 'while' loop except it is easier to code your boolean as false rather than true! </p> 
		<p> The third type of Ruby loop is the ever-popular 'for' loop. The reason this type of loop is super trendy is because it affords the user a lot more finesse and customization than the previous two loops. Put simply, with the for loop one can choose exactly the conditional statement that will govern how many times the code is executed. For example, for 0 .. 5 will perform a loop while a certain variable is within that specific range. As you can see, for is effective when more finesse is needed on the developer's end. But that being said, sometimes the for loop can be a little more wordy and less efficient in terms of DRY programming, so watch out! </p>
