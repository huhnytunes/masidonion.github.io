	<h1> The Fireside Chat </h1> 
		<p> One of the biggest takeaways from Shereef's inspiring fireside chat (of which I truly hope he continues) was the idea that we are all in this thing together. To me, this is a pillar of DBC (from my still limited and rather outside perspective) and one I very much look forward to encapsulating once we arrive in just over a week now. It goes back to what Shereef was saying about the kitchen vs. restuarant mindset: if you approach DBC like you would a restaurant where you expect everything to be served to you perfectly on a silver platter, the program just isn't going to function up to the best of its abilities. Instead, it is important for each and every one of us (students and mentors alike) to enter the program as a whole, but also each and every day individually, like we would if we were entering a communal kitchen: in this kitchen, we cook, create and curate together, as one collective whole, in order to craft the most empowering and liberating process possible. </p>
		<p> To me, this idea of collaborative learning is truly inspiring because it knocks down the educational paradigm of separation between students and teachers, and instead progressively groups us all together into one, diverse, collective whole. Even specifically in relation to us students ourselves, the kitchen mindset dictates that there is no separation between us like typical school would want us to believe (the best succeed; do better = better college; study hard, get good grades, win), but rather an equal whole whereby each student has something unique to bring to the kitchen table that we can all benefit from. This is not competition ... this is <b> collaboration </b> at its finest. </p> 
		<p> I look forward to entering DBC in a week with a truly driven kitchen mindset, fueled by a creator's fire, with the confidence that the other Cicada's will do the same. I am beyond optimistic about these next 9 weeks and cannot wait to make them the most action-packed, education-filled, summer-loving days of my entire life ! </p>
