	<h1> The <b>#MAP</b> method in Ruby! (and how you can better use it) </h1>
		<p> .Map is a built in enumerable method in Ruby that returns a new array with the result of running the given block once for <em>every given element</em> in the enum. For example: <br><br> [1,3,6].map {|x| x + 2} returns a new array: [3,5,8] </p>
		
		<p> This method can be very useful in manipulating arrays just the way you want them to ... A task that otherwise might be difficult and / or time consuming. Because #map is an enumerable, it is rather universal in its nature as it accepts any object as its input. But most importantly, #map is pragmatic in the sense that once you learn it, you will likely be using it repeatedely to great effect before you know it! Here's an example of using the map method to quickly modify an array of names to be properly formatted: <br><br> First, we will define an array of names:<br> names = ['jake', 'john'] <br><br> Then, we will call the map method on the array in order to capitalize the first letters: <br> names.map! {|name| name.capitalize } <br><br> Our new array is: names = ['Jake', 'John'] <br><br> Wallaa !! It's as easy as that! </p>
		
		<p> As you can see, the #map method is an easy and effective way to manipulate objects in Ruby. I hope you now feel confident enough to go out there and use it in your own code !! </p>
