<h1> Three Favorite Websites! </h1> 

	<ol> 
		<li><h3> <a href="Kotaku.com"> Kotaku! </a></h3></li> 
		<p> Kotaku is one of my favorite sites because in not only contains information that is relevent and interesting to me, but it also is well-designed and user-friendly! <br> When looking at the homepage, my vision is drawn immediately to the Kotaku logo in the middle of the screen, which although not overly large, is well-colored in the site's trademark yellow and red that allows it to 'pop' out of screen, for all intents and purposes. Stepping further back, my eyes are drawn more to the large banner ad's present on the site, advertising a new game release 'Dark Souls 2', due to its large nature and graphic-nature (this is to say that it is animated while the rest of the site is more fixed.) From a user's perspective, I do not believe that this banner ad is the most important part of the site, but perhaps from Kotaku's point of view it is (huge revenue stream), therefore it is placed front and center when accessing the site. </p>

		<p> 5 adjectives, visually: engaging, flowey, cutting-edge, fluid, wordy </p>

		<p> The website solves the probelm of 'lack of videogame knowlege' by providing up-to-date and cutting-edge content around the realm of all things videogames. This is why the banner ad across the main page of the site is advertising for Dark Souls 2, one of the most popular game realeases this week. Content includes articles with news, tips, hints and discussion forums. </p> 

		<p> 5 adjectives, content: informational, helpful, practical, fun, silly/serious. <br> These adjectives are complementary to those used above to describe the visual layout of the site, meaning it is a highly cohesive web page. </p>

		<p> The site is easily navigated and most everything can be found from teh homepage thanks to a sleek side-bar design with the most relevant posts, posts on the home stream that are sized based on popularity, and a helpful search bar that is always present in the upper righthand corner. <br> The same is true from other pages on the site, even from article views, because this architecture is maintained no matter where the user might find himself on the page! </p>

		<p> As mentioned above, browsing content is made easy by the innovative nature of the main article stream and furthermore by the handy sidebar listing the most relevant and popular articles, no matter where on the site you are </p> 

		<p> How do I feel after the site: informed, engaged, time-wasted. </p>

		<p> The site sells product via banner ad's which although aren't products that the site sells itself per se, are pay-per-click ad's that allow Kotaku to garner revenue from its advertisements. Furthermore, sponsored posts are present a la Facebook that offer another form of revenue for the strictly information based company. </p> 

		<li><h3><a href="reddit.com"> Reddit! </a></h3></li> 
		<p> Reddit is one of my favorite sites because it always has interesting content that is personalized for me, on my home page, along with engaging discussions via its innovative discussion 'threading' system </p>

		<p>Thanks to a lack of overt distractions on the site, my eyes are immediately drawn to exactly the spot I want them to be when first accessing the site: the personalized news stream in the middle of the page. This is in large part thanks to the lack of overt distractions (a la Kotaku's abrasive banner ad) and also because of the bright blue coloring of the website's news article text. <br> When I step back, my eyes are actually drawn more so to the few yet still present banner ads that exist on the sides of the site. This is due in large part to the fact that these ad's are the only elements that are at all prominent in terms of size when one approaches the computer from a far.<br> Again, I think this ad is important for the website to make money and therefore to stay alive, so understand why it is prominent, but from a user's perspective, these ads are not overly vital. That said, I must appreciate the fact that the banners are subtle and not overly abrasive. </p> 

		<p> 5 adjectives, visually: simple, stylish, sleek, white, clean. 

		<p> The website solves the problem of lack of information, or lack of a good news source, not just for a single topic like Kotaku, but rather from a whole slew (read: pretty much everything) you would ever want to know. Reddit is an alternative news source, meaning you will hear stories from all sides and perspectives without having to worry about how the mainstream media might skew it via the large publications that so many people are used to. Reddit also gives the average laymen a voice when it comes to these topics (and many others) thanks to its refreshing commenting system that allows users to upvote or downvote certain comments to bring them to the top of the discussion. The same is true for articles, meaning the links at the top of the homepage have been democratically selected as the most relevenat and pressing. I very much enjoy this egalitarian model! </p> 

		<p> 5 adjectives, content: diverse, unbiased, engaging, informative, silly/serious. <br> These adjectives work well with those mentioned above to describe the content, therefore the site is highly cohesive. </p>

		<p> Thanks to the up-voting system, more often than not, the information you are looking for is near the top of the page, making it extremely easy to get what you want when you visit Reddit (one of the site's biggest pluses). More than that, a search bar in the upper-right corner of the screen (present no matter what page you are on) that also features an advanced search option makes it beyond easy to locate exactly what you want. </p>

		<p> Content browsing is easy and intutive, although a lot of scrolling must be done, especially on comment's pages, in order to get to the bottom of the thread. Perhaps the site in the future might find a way to surmount this limitation? </p>

		<p> How does site make me feel: knowledgable, happy, sad, angry, pretty much any emotion you can imagine really. But that's the beauty of Reddit </p> 

		<p> The site, similarly to Kotaku, sells product (not its own) through banner ads and sponsored posts. </p> 

		<li><h3><a href="highexistence.com" > High Existence! </a></h3></li>
		<p> High existence is one of my favorite sites because it offers fascinating articles on a wide-array of subjects that I would not be able to find otherwise. I never leave the site dissapointed; I always learn something.</p> 
		<p> When viewing the homepage, I am immediatley drawn to the multiple large and colorful image files that populate the page, each one linked to one of the featured articles on the site at the moment.<br> Even when I step back from the page, this is still what I see ... And it is beautiful. This is how a home page should be designed! Visually pleasing but also functionally designed. True webpage bliss. </p> 
		<p>5 adjectives, visually: colorful, beautiful, blissful, organized, boxey</p> 
		<p> The site solves the problem of expanding your mind without having to search the far reaches of the galaxy to do so (although it by no means discourages this). HE supplies content that is thought-provoking and edgy, forcing you to think about normal subjects in very different ways. I enjoy this 'outside the box' approach and definitely leave HE satisfied everytime, no matter how much or little I do on the site!</p> 
		<p> 5 adjectives, content: thought-provoking, mind-expanding, alternative, edgy, big. <br> Again, these adjectives play into those described above for the visual nature very well, thus leading to a well-exectued website.</p> 
		<p> Thanks to the large images that are prominent from the homepage, it is easy to know what article I want to delve into from the very start. Below the main featured articles, there are also 'top' tabs that feature top posts, images, videos and comments. This also allows for ease of access. Again, there is a nice search bar on every page that allows the user to find what they want, when they want it.</p>
		<p> Browsing content on the site does require some tabbing and scrolling, but overall it is a fairly positive and intuitive experience</p> 
		<p> How I feel from site: educated, intellectual and ungrounded. </p>
		<p> The site doesn't seem to sell anything. </p>
