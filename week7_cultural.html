<h1> Values and Stereotype Threat </h1> 
	<p> Values are the essence of who we are: if we strip everything else away, peel all those other layers off of our onion, values are (and should be) very close to the core of our true Person. In this sense, our values really define who we are and for the most part, how we act. Of course, many a times there are situations where our ego's, thoughts, memories, or current status might get in the way our action. But I would like to think that if we were faced with the end of the world and suddenly all else was stripped away, that our values would be the sole proprietor of our immediate action therein. </p> 
	<p> On a personal level, I try to adhere to my values as often as I can because I know that by doing this I am staying true to myself. Especially when it comes to stereotype threat, my values dictate that I will not unfairly stereotype someone and / or treat them differently because they are different. But of course, in reality, this cannot and is not always the case. I think this proves the point I made above that although we can hold positive, well-fortified values based on positive attributions, sometimes even those can go astray. I talked about this briefly in my blog from last week where I noted that subliminally we are constantly being affected by powers unbeknownst to ourselves. This is the subconscious well at work, manipulating us invisibly yet powerfully. It is the truth and we cannot hide from it. But again, I think there is an out (of sorts). </p> 
	<p> As mentioned last week, the best way to circumvent and eventually conquer stereotype threat is to simply be aware of it. This awareness breads a knowing whereby we can notice, actively, when we might be succumbing to its pull. Although this is obviously easier said than done, the truth is by working on this everyday, we can get closer and closer to the point where we simply see the stereotype threat as out there and consciously decide to step around it. Especially in office / work / community environments this is tantamountly important, as we are surrounded by similar people on a consistent basis and it's easy to forget the fact that we have to respect these people to the upmost extent of our abilities. Personally, I look forward to the challenge and am optimistic based on the outstanding group of individuals I am lucky enough to be surrounded by in my cohort that in the end this will all be no problem at all. </p> 
	<p> <strong> See you all soon !! </strong> </p>
