	<h1>Pairing Feedback!</h1> 
		<p> I have thoroughly enjoyed the pairing process thus far, and feel that each of my sessions has been effective, enlightening and fun! Pairing with someone to solve a challenge, although new entirely in concept to me, definitely is when it comes to pair-programming. So the process has been a learning experience ... But in the best way possible. It is a whole different thing when you can collobarate on a tough problem, bouncing ideas off one another, rather than just sitting on your own computer, struggling by yourself. In this sense, pairing is a very effective way to both learn and accomplish tasks at hand! </p> 
		<p> To me, the collobaration aspect itself is that which is most enjoyable about pairing. This is to say that simply the fact that we are two people, separated by perhaps even an entire country, that can still work together on a tough problem is mind-blowing to me .. I just think it's so cool! I always enjoy working with others so this is a perfect way to utilize this skill and subsequently learn new ones in the process! I look forward to continuing to pair both remotely in the near future and truly collobaratively in the not-so-distant (DBC) one. </p>
		<p> The hardest part about pairing (other than the logistics of finding the best time for both of you) is the fact that at this point, we are working remotely, therefore there needs to be an emphasis on vocalizing <strong>all</strong> of your thinking. This is compared to a true DBC environment where we might be able to get away with saying less because the other person is sitting right next to us and can see exactly what we are doing on the screen. The vocalizing of thoughts was awkward for me at first, but I believe I have gotten much better and see that by doing so, the session and partner benefit greatly!<p> 

	<h1>Feedback feedback</h1> 
		<p> It was an interesting experience reading feeback: on the one hand, a lot of it was positive and helpful, and made me feel good about the work I am doing and the pair-up's I have had. On the other, I realized that sometimes it is hard for me to take criticism, even when it is constructive, because perhaps I am not as comfortable with my insecurities as I would hope that I am. So I felt mixed-feelings when reading feedback -- a mixed bag of sorts -- althougH I know that this spectrum of emotions is key to growth and therefore I am happy to have experienced them via the feedbackinator. </p> 
		<p> In this sense, the feedback has been helpful to my learning as it is specifically from the people I have worked with and thanks to anonymnomity, they can be completely candid. This is a good thing: it means that they will be forthcoming with suggestions and constructive feedback, which to me has been very helpful as this usually isn't the case in the real world (hard to give feedback to someone face to face).</p> 
		<p> Based on all the feedback, I will make a big point of being a better listener in my sessions: although this is something I have been working on, I know that I have more work to do. Sometimes, I love to fill space with words and although sometimes this can be effective (for example, when I am vocalizing my thought process), sometimes I understand it can be overpowering which is a negative in a pairing sessions where both partners must have an equal say. This said, I am happy to have seen this feedback first hand and now look forward to addressing it head on!</p>
		<p> Writing feedback was similarly awkward at first, but now it seems like a natural part of the pairing process: after you pair, you give feedback, so the other might improve. This makes a lot of sense to me, and I hope that others have listened to my constructive feedback so they might do better in the future! </p>
		<p> The most difficult part of giving feedback, for me, is being open and honest. Being anonymous helps with this, but even still, sometimes I tend to sugar-coat things and in this situation, this is not the best course of action. But I am learning and growing because of all of this, and look forward to doing it a whole lot more!</p>
