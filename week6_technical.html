<h1> Functional vs. Object-Oriented (OO) Programming </h1>
	<p> Functional and Object-Oriented Programming are two ways to the play the same game with varied approaches. As a relatively new 'programmer' (even now, I am reluctant to fully use that word in relation to my own status as a developer as I still feel distinctly novice in terms of the profession, but alas), I did not immediately understand the difference between these two paradigms: I know that Ruby is OO in nature, but what does that really mean? Have I programmed functionally yet? What really is the difference then? </p>
	<p> To answer these questions, a little bit of Internet research was in order. The biggest point of difference I have come to understand between Functional and OO programming is their relation to data producers vs data consumers within a given piece of code (or, an entire program). Object-oriented programming, as I have come to experience first-hand over the last few weeks with Ruby, makes it very easy for the developer to create new Classes and to have objects (ie. methods) within them; it is highly encouraged and necessary, actually. These are example of data-producers that are at the heart of OO programs. In other words, OO emphasises the inclusion of many objects, and uses these as a foundation in order to build up from. On the other hand, functional programming does just the opposite by emphasizing the use of data-consumers in order to build a program rather than data-producers. This means that instead of approaching a problem with classes and various objects, the functional programmer looks at what they already have and asks how they can better build <em>functions</em> on top of these in order to satisfy and solve the various criteria. </p>
	<p> Although writing this now I feel like I do understand the inherent difference between these two approaches, I must admit that until I am more experienced with using both programming styles, I cannot say I am any sort of expert of the matter. Of course, research such as this is a necessary part of any learning process. But more than anything, it is the experiential knowledge that is gained from simply doing / performing the act itself that is priceless in terms of bolstering knowledge and understanding. </br> So, when I look back at my pre-stated questions above, I can say confidently that I see the difference between these two types of programming approaches, but I also know that in the future I will be able to explain and teach even better thanks to an increase burst of experiential knowledge a la DBC !! </p>
