<h1> Stereotype Threat (and all of us)</h1> 
	<p> We've all felt it before: that nagging feeling in the back of our head (or heart, for that matter) that tells us we shouldn't be doing something. No, I am not talking about the gut-wrenching reaction that we feel when we've done something wrong, like put-down a friend or insult a family member -- this is too retroactive to what I am considering here. The feeling I am talking about is more proactive than anyting: we feel it when we are doing something that we know (either consciously or sub-consciously) is different than perhaps what we should be doing; or should be performing; or should be thinking. The important word to note here is <em>should</em>. Should here means that we have a certain perception on the way that things are supposed to be, <em> should be</em>, and therefore tailor our actions in order to meet this social standard. This is <b>stereotype threat</b>. And it affects each and every one of us, every single day. </p> 
	<p> I remember distinctly a time when I fell victim to the deceptively effective hands of stereotype threat. It was in 7th grade. At my first, real, middle-school dance. I had never really been to a dance before. At least, not while I was even remotely self-aware. This is to say that of course in elementary school there were 'dances', but all that really meant was an excuse to run around and play tag with your friends and / or hide from all the parent chaperones until they were convinced you had genuinely gone missing (at least, that was elementary dances for me lol).<br> But now it was middle school, kids were growing up, and so was I. I knew this dance was different the second I stepped through the doors into the assembly hall .. People were really dancing! I didn't even know how to react. I thought dancing was just something people did on TV, in the movies, in-between and forever throughout our mediated minds; but in real-life, no way! And let me just clarify here, I am not even talking about the 'slow-dancing' with the other sex which of course caused awkwardness for me and countless others down the road. No, I am simply talking about dancing in its most visceral, primal form: moving to that crazy thing we call music. <br> Back on story here, to stereotype threat. Well, you see, what happened to me I only now can fully comprehend but back then I simply felt confused and at a loss. At this dance, all the girls were dancing: swaying their hips, jiving their thighs, bouncing their feet. It was as if they were born with the knowledge of how to do it (at least, that is what it felt like then). And so I said, 'HEY, why not me too ?!'. But as I approached the dancing group with confidence at an all time high (I was going to do it!), I suddenly drew a blank ... I could not seem to do it! Try as I might to move my body to the music, it simply was not happening. And this is not to say I had never danced before .. Practicing at my own home with my own family was always such a cinch! Embarrased and unable to move (seeminlgy), I waddled away from the now confused group of girls and back to the corner that I came from. It was rather devasting, but don't worry, I survived! </p>
	<p> I believe that stereotype threat sums this whole situation up pretty well: although everything in me was prepared to dance that night, once I realized that it was <em>only<em> girls out there dancing on the floor, I suddenly froze. My mind raced: are only girls allowed to dance? Can guys just not do it? What I am doing here then in the first place ?? I suddenly fell victim to a negative stereotype that clouded my mind and froze my forward action. Granted, at the time, I was very young. But that being said, I think this is a crystal-clear picture of how stereotype threat works in real-world, more adult-like sitautions: even if we have every single thing within us to perform a certain action and to do it well (or at least, to the best of our ability), sometimes there are forces outside of us that dictate otherwise. </p>
	<p> Although this realization can be a little overwhelming, I think it is still vital we all understand it. Why, you ask? Because by understanding a certain phenomenon, we afford ourselves the opportunity to circumvent, master, even conquer it once and for all! Granted, I do admit, there are always invisible forces working on us via society, media and elsewhere at all the time. But even still, I believe that by understanding the stereotype effect we can work to overcome it in our day to day lives. This awareness can ultimately bolster a sense of empowerment that tells us that we don't need to play victim to blatant and unnecessary negative stereotypes. </p> 
	<p> Indeed, we just have to be above it. Sometimes it's as simple as that. But I truly do not mean  to belittle this clearly present and powerful feature of societal living. I just hope that with a little bit of understanding and positive feedback from those around us (girls can program too!!!), we can take one step forwards and look back on those nasty things called stereotypes and laugh at their attempt to constantly bind us to what we are not : ) </p>
