	<h1> Emotional Conflicts (and what to do next) </h1> 
		<p> A few years ago, I remember a distinct moment where I had an emotional conflict / argument with one of my best friends about they way that he was treating himself, especially in terms of his poor nutrition habits. I must explain, at this point of my life, I was finally starting to treat my own body better and felt very good in doing so. Yet because of this, I also felt simultaneously that everyone else should do the same .. Why not? I thought. If I felt better, why shouldn't they change their diet to be healthier too ...? </p> 
		<p> What happened was that I confronted my friend late one night about the microwave snack he was eating. Now normally, this friend and I get along very well and rarely have problems / arguments. Yet, I still felt the need to 'call him out' because I just could not take it anymore. In the end, it was a five minute 'conversation' that was realistically more like a personal rant on my side .. Eventually, my friend just got up and left the room. In retrospect, I respect him for this because I was simply being immature and lacked understanding of his own situation. </p>
		<p> The source of the conflict was my own personal, juvenile thought that I knew better than he what is best to eat. Although perhaps I might have known and experienced a little bit more about nutrtion, the honest truth is that you simply cannot tell someone, especially a close friend, what to do or not to do. In this sense, I handled the situation rather poorly, because instead of coaching my friend and helpign to bring him up, I instead ended up putting him down, helping nothing. I regretted this emotional confrontation shortly thereafterwards, yet in this light, I learned a lot from the experience </p>
		<p> Ultimately my actions, in this case a verbal outburst, only helped to hurt the situation. Once you begin to talk donw to someone or tell them what to do, from my experience I have found that the other person 'turns-off' and no longer tends to listen. The most effective way to help someone and teach them something new is to do it from a level of equals, rather than seeing you as right and he / she as wrong. This is a key point in any emotional confict, and one that I learned the hard way .. but learned nonetheless. </p>
		<p> If I could go back, I would act differently in the sense of 1. I would not confront my friend so late at night when emotions tend to be most volatile, and 2. address him as an equal in order to most effectively benefit him (and ultimately, or relationship). </p>
		<p> Every situation has a lesson to teach, and from this emotional conflict I learned much about interpersonal relationships and life in general. </p>
