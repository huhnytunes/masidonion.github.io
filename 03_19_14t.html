	<h1> Why is JavaScript so popular in web development?</h1> 
		<p> To me, the main reason that JavaScript is so popular in web development (and remains so to this day after so many years), is 
			due to what I would call a positive feedback loop. But let me explain: <br> What I mean by this is the fact that JS became popular
			(due to reasons I will mention shortly) and since then, has ridden the wave of success to become a nearly ubiquitous language. Therefore, the more universal the language became (or, any langauge becomes), the more likely it will continue to be used: in other words, languages are creatures of exponential growth. Think about it: why would you want to use a language that servers / clients / other technologies might not be able to read? Answer: you wouldn't. As a developer, you want to use a language with the highest rate of success when it comes to client / server-side processing. When it comes to HTML and web development, this language is JavaScript. </p> 
		<p> But how did this rise to fame happen in the first place? <br> I think the biggest causal factor here is the opportune timing of the 		introduction of JS. Put simply, it was the perfect time for an object-oriented, user-driven language to serve the Internet and JS 			filled these needs better than any of the alternatives (at the time). And again, once it was accepted as the language, or the 				'standard', it was only time before the language became universal. Such is the case today. <br> Apart from this basic reason of 			timing, JS does indeed do a solid job at providing functionality via its fast and easy infastructure and reduced server load thanks to 
			its ability to compute crucial packets of information on the client-side, thus freeing up memory on the server to perform more complicated tasks effectively. </p>
		<p> In the end, JavaScript is a language that has asserted itself as a huge player in the web infastructure game and that doesn't look like 	it will be giving up these reigns anytime soon. But of course, there is always that next language, waiting around the next corner, just 	waiting for its chance to shine ... Time will only tell!
