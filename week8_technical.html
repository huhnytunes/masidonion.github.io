<h1> Dynamic vs. Static Typed Languages </h1>
	<p> According to Wikipedia, a type system is "a collection of rules that assign a property called a type to the various constructs". In other words, type systems are the framework upon which things like variables, objects, functions, etc ... are formed, but more importantly, given meaning. Without typing, all of the various things we call 'code' would be nothing more than bits, bytes and little pieces of digital data, all without any real meaning. By assigning a data type to the data, we are able to form a symbolic system within a program (or, programming language). A good comparison would be to the English language, which would just be a bunch of words in the form of sounds without meaning unless we knew exactly what each was referencing (in this case, specific visual images in the real world). Ultimately, type systems work to reduce the amount of bugs that might appear in any given program because they limit the number of errors that are possible via standardization and consistency. That being said, there is not just one type system: there are many. And of those many, it is hard to say finitely which one is best. In this abbreviated blog post, I will delve into Dynamic and Static Typed Languages, discussing the pro's and con's of each in reference to the overall programming pie. </p> 
	<p> The easiest way to compare dynamic and static typed languages is in looking at the way that each type-checks, or verifies, code. It is rather simple actually: a <b> static typed language </b> type checks the program safety of a code based on analysis of the static source code, while a <b> dynamic typed language </b> checks the code dynamically at its run time. Because source code is static and run code is not, this paints a clear picture of how each of these typed langauges work differently in approach and execution. In terms of which is better, proponents of static typed languages argue that it allows for earlier detection of programming errors, better documentation and increased runtime efficiency. Although this all sounds well and good, critics of static type say that this rarely is true in the real world, which is inherently dynamic, ever-changing and highly maleable. Therefore, static typed languages fall flat because they are not able to adequately adjust for the dynamic nature of the world, so for example, the increased runtime efficiency might fall flat if a program needs to adjust based on a mobile device and a static language can simply not account for this. </p> 
	<p> On the other hand, proponents of the dynamic typed languages argue that static typing is too rigid and that the soft nature of dynamic langauge allows it to bend and adjust to systems that are constantly changing and / or have unknown requirements; the status of real world systems, they say. I tend to agree with this argument and believe it is a huge distinguishing factor here: of course the world we live in is dynamic and although this does not apply to every programming application, the number of times that a dynamic type language is needed is only increasing as our world grows ever-more complex, so why not just hop on the band-wagon now? That being said, static typed languages do have a place within the programming culture and will persist into the future as they satisfy needs quite well in certain situations. But for me, the world is dynamic and the future only moreso, so let's at least get comfortable with dymamic typed languages and checks now so that we might be more prepared for this fluidic future. </p>
