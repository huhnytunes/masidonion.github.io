<h1> The Biggest Problem Facing the Tech World </h1> 
	<p> In my humble, unbiased but perhaps rather emotional opinion, the biggest problem facing the tech world today is the sheer disconnect between the power afforded by the technology and our inability to properly teach it at the most fundamental level. A rudimentary example of this is my grandma, who owns an iPhone (don't ask me why), but for the life of her (and me), just cannot figure the damn thing out! Try as I might to explain to her the basic functions / concepts / applications, it just seems to be inherently hard for her to grasp such subject matter. This is the disconnect I refer to in my opening: we own powerful pieces of technology with next to unlimited potential, but when it comes to explaining this to someone who might not know as much as you or me, it just doesn't seem to work! </p>
	<p> I attribute this disconnect to a few different things: for one, technology has grown increasingly complex in proportion to its saturation rate, meaning that as more people get their hands on the technology, so too has its complication factor increased. This is to say that while in the past mobile phones only served as phones, now they are much more, including but not limited to: browsers, cameras, messagers, games, flashlights, GPS's, compass, etc, etc ... Although the price point for technology is now lower, the barrier of entry in terms of comprehension is higher. Perhaps if my grandma's iPhone only did calling and messaging, I might be able to help her grasp these two functions to the point of pragmatism, yet because there are SO many other things to think about, my theory is that she is simply overwhelmed by the seemingly endless possibilities (and most likely, always will be). </p>
	<p> This is not to say that new technology is not trying to become more user friendly. Indeed, the iPhone itself (and Apple specifically) try as a best practice to design their software / hardware to be as user compatible as possible, as do countless other companies. This is a positive trend, and I do admit that it is helping lower the entry level for people who want to enter into the technological sphere. Yet, there is still my grandma, and likely myriad more people in the world who still find it next to impossible to grasp these seemingly 'user-friendly' concepts and technologies. So what is it really then? </p>
	<p> But really, the biggest problem facing technology in this sense is the lack of (or more specifically, non-existence) of tech languages that are laymen-proof and easy to read. Yes, Ruby tries (and nearly succeeds), but even still, the beautiful langauge that DBC is built around is still not 'English' enough to help ease complete strangers into the inner-workings of technology. I believe this is a huge problem with technology today! Think about it: if we could program in a language that was nearly identical to English (think working pseduocode), <b>ANYONE</b> and I mean <b>ANYONE</b>, could use it. Not only would this inspire people young to old to take up programming and begin creating things, this advance would allow for someone even like my Grandma to begin to comprehend technology. </br> They say the best way to understand something is to do it yourself. And if people without any programming background or technological skills could hop right into programming thanks to extremely readable and intuitive languages, this would completely revolutionize the technological sphere and be a huge step forward for humanity as a whole! </p>

	<p> I guess we'll just have to wait and see (hehe) </p>
