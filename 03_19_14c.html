	<h1> Shame (and how to deal with it) </h1> 
		<p> Dr. Harold Grossman describes shame as, "a protective response to keep us connected to the group rather than wondering off dangerously by 	ourselves ..." so as to help us "survive". To me, shame is much more simple than that: shame is the way we feel when we are embarrased by our actions. This can manifest itself in many ways: <br> For one, shame is what happens when you think you can't do something that everyone esle can. I can see this being a problem in an environment such as DBC because there will be plenty of new tasks present and inevitably, individuals will perceive themselves as not up to the standards required to learn and / or complete them. Although this is a valid, human response, I think that it is important to understand that it is just this: <strong>human</strong>. In other words, we <strong>all</strong> feel this certain type of shame, therefore by understanding this, we might circumvent some of the 'guilt' associated with feeling something like this in relation to an 'imposter-like syndrome'. <br> In my opnion, the best way to do with shame, and one that has helped me with it in the past, is to attack it head-on. This is to say that instead of running and hiding from our feelings (in this case, shame), we must instead stare it right in the face and challenge it to really show its true colors. This can, for all of us, be a very scary thing: the last thing we want to do (or more importantly, are programmed to do) is to look at our must visceral, deep emotions that make up the inner-workings of who we are as people. But I promise that if one can muster the courage to do so, the shame itself will dissapear right in front of our eyes. Why you might ask? <br> I believe this is because once we give real credit to our feelings, meaning we acknowledge them as real and valid, we are able to see them for what they really are: manifestations of our own fears and expectations. When this can be viewed clearly, we see just how paper thin then these emotions tend to be, and by having this moment of clarity, we gain a chance to circumvent and / or completely conquer the feelings for good. <br> One of the most crucial aspects of this whole process is that much-used but rarely-understood word called mindfulness. Mindfulness in this situation means that we are 1. mindfull of the fact that we are feeling shame and 2. mindfull enough of ourselves and our own sitautions that we can actually look at this emotion in a very visceral sense. By cultivating mindfulness, we can then begin the process of overcoming guilt and conquering our shame. We all have it. Now it's time to take back control! <br> More on this fascinating phenomenon next time ...
